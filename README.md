ðŸš— Porsche Evolution Website Clone ðŸš—

As a fun project, I challenged myself to create a clone of the Porsche Evolution website. The concept showcases the evolution of Porsche cars over the years. As you scroll down the page, you see the iconic cars transform through time, offering a visual journey of Porsche's innovation and design.

This was a great way to sharpen my skills in web development while working with modern frontend technologies like smooth scrolling and image transitions. It was a fun and rewarding project to build!
